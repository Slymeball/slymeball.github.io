## Or, "Whoopsies, I Forged A New Identity And Discovered Myself"

*February 12, 2026*

First of all, no, I'm not dead, nor have I left the internet. In fact, I've been quite active, just not as Slyme.

This all really started in January of last year. Past the midnight hours on January 20th, I was awake designing a new Minecraft avatar. The concept was quite simple: picture how I would want to look *if I was a girl*.

Now, I had already been questioning my gender at that point. I didn't feel comfortable as a man, but I had never really pictured myself as a woman. However, any time I got to questioning my gender, I just shrugged it off and said to myself that "I'd get to it eventually." Well, it turned out, that wintry night, that "eventually" would come.

As soon as I was done, I shared a photo of it to an IRL queer friend with the caption "fuck off why am i actually pulling this off" and "at this rate we might have to drop the 'honorary' title."[^1]

The issue is, I had grown too attached to this representation of myself. I wanted to actually use her as a persona online and not just keep her hidden away on my hard drive. So, I ended up buying another Minecraft account, especially since I had some GameStop credit left over from the Christmas season beforehand that I wasn't gonna use for anything else.

I started playing as that girl, and, frankly, I hadn't felt happier. I made friends as her, became core parts of communities as her, and even started speaking in voice chats as her. I had finally broken out of the shell I had stuffed myself into for so long.

The only thing I regret is that I left everyone else behind. I wish I had said something sooner, stopped being so nervous about coming out to those I was close with. Unfortunately, the best time to do so has passed—luckily, the second best time has not.

## What Now?

Effectively, my time as Slyme on the internet is over. I don't plan on deleting everything, especially not yet; however, I also don't plan on being active as Slyme any time soon either. If you wish to contact me, I'll keep my inboxes open.

Wish to find me elsewhere on the internet? [Shoot an email](mailto:whereareyou@slyme.xyz) and I'll give you vague, cryptic hints. :P (you can also send theories in there if you're so inclined)
